# Ray-Tracing-Using-cpp
# C++ Ray Tracing Project

## Overview

This project is a ray tracing algorithm implemented in C++ to simulate light interactions with 3D spheres. The algorithm computes reflections, refractions, and shading to render realistic images of 3D scenes.

## Features

- Ray-sphere intersection computation
- Reflection and refraction handling
- Diffuse shading
- Recursive ray tracing
- Randomly generated spheres
- PPM image output

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- CMake (optional for build configuration)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ray-tracing-cpp.git
cd ray-tracing-cpp
